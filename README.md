# object simulation game
<h5>
  <p>This project was created using the AI's:
  <p>"Augment" extention on the app "visual studio code"
  <p>ChatGPT 4o / 4o mini
  <hr>
  <p>This is a simulation game with a toolbar with different kinds of tools including create, freeze, bond, etc.
  <hr>
  <p>Create; makes LMB spawn a physics based circle
  <p>Menu includes a color picker for solids, liquid, and gasses (states of matter are a W.I.P.)
  <hr>
  <p>Drag; drags / moves objects around with LMB
  <p>Menu includes a move tool option (no sway drag tool), and an experimental smooth drag option
  <hr>
  <p>Freeze; freezes the clicked circle
  <hr>
  <p>Bond; ties together 2 circles with LMB
  <p>Menu includes a rigid connection (no fixed position apart from one another), and a loose connection
  <hr>
  <p>Settings; contains a bunch of settings 
  <p>Menu includes sliders for gravity, drag strength, and air resistance
  <hr>
  <p>Reset; self explainatory, just resets the simulation
